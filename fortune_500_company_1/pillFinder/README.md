# PILL-FINDER
This prompt was given to demonstrate an understanding of basic search
functionality.  Though, the implementation I created was not ideal to
scale, my thought process during the interview did not initially jump
to an optimized algorithm. In this repository, I have both the 
implementation that I had given during the interview, and a proposed
solution having a few hours to sleep on the problem.

## PROMPT
Given a list of medication names and a search query, render a filtered
list of medications that match the search query.  For example given
the following inputs:
- [ACETAMINOPHEN,
ADDERALL,
ALPRAZOLAM,
AMITRIPTYLINE,
AMLODIPINE,
AMOXICILLIN,
ATIVAN,
ATORVASTATIN]
- AM

render the following:
AMITRIPTYLINE,
AMLODIPINE,
AMOXICILLIN
