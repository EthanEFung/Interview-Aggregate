# Interview-Aggregate
The technical interview process can be tough. That said, I've always learned something new at every interview. Here is a collection of the technical interview questions I've been asked, and the solutions I would implement now in response to these prompts.

## About the Structure of this Repo

Each repo represents an interview I had, and all the pertaining information.  Look at the read me first, to get a sense of the circumstances of the interview, and to understand the problem I was tasked to solve. Reporting any bugs that this repository has will be greatly appreciated.
