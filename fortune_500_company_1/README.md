# Fortune 500 Company
This company had automated a coding challenge to me, with three 
seperate technical questions. After the coding portion of the challenge
finished, a video response was illicited to explain my thought process.
Because this is a repository, you'll be able to find my response in this
README. 

A little disclaimer, I am producing the prompt from memory, so the accuracy 
what the question actually entailed might be skewed. My prompts will give 
the general idea of the problem presented to me.
