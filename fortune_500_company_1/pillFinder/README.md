# PILL-FINDER
This prompt was given to demonstrate an understanding of basic search
functionality.  Though, the implementation I created was not ideal to
scale, my thought process during the interview did not initially jump
to an optimized algorithm. In this repository, I have both the 
implementation that I had given during the interview, and a proposed
solution having a few hours to sleep on the problem.
