# Fortune 500 Company No. 1
This company had automated a coding challenge to me, with three 
seperate technical questions. After the coding portion of the challenge
finished, a video response was illicited to explain my thought process.
Because this is a repository, you'll be able to find my response in this
README. 

A little disclaimer, I am producing the prompt from memory, so the  
accuracy of what the question was might be skewed. My prompts will give 
the general idea of the problem presented to me.

### OUT SMART - Explained
For this problem, my thought was to break this problem into two major sections
(1) The Recursive build of the sequence
(2) Processing each individual integer seperately

- The recursive build
Quite simply if we factor out the process that each integer undergoes,
what we are left with is a problem of building a decrementing sequence
from n to 1.  Because I was under time pressure, my main concern was
not confusing myself with complex algorithms.  Admittedly, I could
have just as easily solved this problem iteratively, but at the time
I reasoned that recursion was just as easy and required less boilerplate.

- Processing the integers
The solution logic for this prompt is similar to FIZZBUZZ in that one
easy solution is to check whether the integer satisfies one, none, or both 
conditions that are given in the prompt.  While specific conditions differed
in this coding challenge, the solution I implement is similar. I 
am create a result string that will print out in the case that
one, the other. If both conditions are met, the result string contains both
words because both conditions are met. Else I print out the number.
